# Chess Learning App - Master Universal Opening Systems

A comprehensive React Native chess learning application designed to help users master universal, mirrored chess opening systems through adaptive learning, spaced repetition, and game-based learning.

## Project Overview

This application implements the complete blueprint for a modern chess learning platform that transforms dense expert analysis into an interactive, personalized learning experience. The app uses a "Digital Coach" persona to provide Socratic guidance, integrates the FSRS spaced repetition algorithm, and features human-like AI opponents for realistic practice.

### 4. FSRS Spaced Repetition Algorithm ✅

`src/services/srs/fsrs.ts`

Implementation of the state-of-the-art FSRS algorithm:

- **Separates Difficulty and Stability**: More accurate than SM-2
- **Adaptive scheduling**: Personalizes to user's learning curve
- **Supports both move and concept training**: Bifurcated SRS system
- **Advanced metrics**:
  - Calculate retrievability
  - Forecast future reviews
  - Track retention rates
  - Monitor average difficulty/stability

Key functions:
- `scheduleNextReview()`: Main scheduling function
- `createSRSItem()`: Initialize new items
- `getDueItems()`: Query items due for review
- `getForecast()`: Predict future workload

### 5. Design System ✅

`src/constants/theme.ts`

**Modern, Friendly Theme**:

- Clean, light backgrounds
- DM Sans typography (fallback to System)
- Comprehensive spacing scale
- Consistent border radius
- Elevation/shadow system

**Board Themes**: 5 options for user customization
**Coach Personalities**: 4 unlockable coaches with different tones

### 6. Type System ✅

`src/types/index.ts`

Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for:
- Chess types (Square, Move, Position)
- Opening systems and variations
- SRS items and parameters
- Digital Coach prompts and interventions
- Mini-game configurations
- User profile and achievements
- Game sessions and analysis
- Navigation types

### 7. Sound System ✅

`src/services/audio/soundService.ts`

Multi-sensory audio feedback using expo-av:

- **Context-aware sounds**: Different sounds for moves, captures, checks, checkmate
- **Gamification sounds**: Success, error, streak, level-up, achievement unlock
- **Smart playback**: Respects user preferences, preloading for low latency
- **Sound sequences**: Chain multiple sounds for compound events
- **Key function**: `playMoveSound()` - Intelligently selects sound based on move type

### 8. MoveTrainer Component ✅

`src/components/organisms/MoveTrainer.tsx`

SRS-based drill for learning opening sequences (Procedural Memory):

- **Progressive training**: Walk through opening lines move-by-move
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual and audio response to correct/incorrect moves
- **Adaptive rating**: Grades performance (Easy/Good/Hard/Again) based on mistakes
- **Progress tracking**: Shows move count and completion percentage
- **Integrated with FSRS**: Automatically schedules next review
- **Hint system**: Optional hints without penalty

### 9. Digital Coach Dialog ✅

`src/components/organisms/DigitalCoachDialog.tsx`

Socratic dialogue system for pedagogical guidance:

- **Multiple prompt types**: Questions, hints, explanations, encouragement

### 10. Bishop's Prison Mini-Game ✅

`src/components/organisms/BishopsPrison.tsx`

Asymmetric endgame drill teaching "Good vs. Bad Bishop":

- **Educational setup**: User has good bishop, AI has bad bishop
- **Win condition**: Exploit the trapped bad bishop to win the endgame
- **Integrated coach**: Socratic prompts explain the concept during play
- **Performance metrics**: Tracks moves and time to completion
- **Concept reinforcement**: Clear explanation of good vs. bad bishops
- **Replayability**: Reset and try different approaches

### 11. Opening Lines Database ✅

`src/constants/openingLines.ts`

Sample repertoire for 5 universal opening systems:

- **King's Indian Attack**: 2 lines with variations
- **Colle System**: Main line with e4 break
- **Stonewall Attack**: Classic pawn chain formation
- **London System**: Early Bf4 development
- **Torre Attack**: Classical pin setup
- **Utility functions**: Get lines by system, random selection, ID lookup

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Pedagogical First

The app rejects the "engine-first" approach. Instead of raw evaluations (-3.1), it uses a **Digital Coach** that provides:
- Socratic questions ("What square is critical for your opponent?")
- Contextual hints
- Visual highlighting
- Encouraging guidance

### 2. Bifurcated SRS System

Solves the "Chessable Problem":
- **MoveTrainer**: Drills procedural memory (move sequences)
- **ConceptTrainer**: Drills declarative memory (strategic understanding)

### 3. Game-Based Learning

Beyond simple gamification:
- Mini-games use **asymmetric mechanics** to teach concepts
- Examples: Bishop's Prison, Transposition Maze, The Fuse
- Intrinsically fun while teaching strategy

### 4. Human-Like AI

Uses **Maia neural network**:
- Trained on millions of human games
- Makes realistic human mistakes (not random blunders)
- Different ELO levels (1100, 1300, 1500, 1900)
- Teaches users to punish actual human errors
